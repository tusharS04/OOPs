ðŸ’¨Inheritance:
To inherit a class, you simply incorporate the definition of one class into another by using the extends keyword.

Syntax:- 
class subclass-name extends superclass-name { 
// body of class
}
â€¢	You can only specify one superclass for any subclass that you create. 
â€¢	Java does not support the inheritance of multiple superclasses into a single subclass
â€¢	You can, as stated, create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a subclass becomes a superclass of another subclass. 
â€¢	However, no class can be a superclass of itself.
â€¢	Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of the superclass that have been declared as private.
