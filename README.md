# OOPs
Brief notes on OOPs Concept and it's code snippet (Java)

ðŸ’¨Class
â€¢	A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class.
â€¢	A class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects.

When you declare an object of a class, you are creating an instance of that class.
Thus, a class is a logical construct. An object has physical reality. (That is, an object occupies space in memory.)

ðŸ’¨Object
Objects are characterized by three essential properties:
â€¢	State
â€¢	Identity
â€¢	behavior.
The state of an object is a value from its data type. The identity of an object distinguishes one object from another.
It is useful to think of an objectâ€™s identity as the place where its value is stored in memory.
The behavior of an object is the effect of data-type operations.

â€¢	The dot operator links the name of the object with the name of an Instance Variable (All the Variables inside the object).
Example= sout(student1.rollno)
â€¢	Although commonly referred to as the dot operator, the formal specification for Java categorizes the . as a separator.
â€¢	The 'new' keyword dynamically allocates(that is, allocates at run time)memory for an object & returns a reference to it.
â€¢	This reference is, more or less, the address in memory of the object allocated by new.
â€¢	This reference is then stored in the variable.
â€¢	Thus, in Java, all class objects must be dynamically allocated.
